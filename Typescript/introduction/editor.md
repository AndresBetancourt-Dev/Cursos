# Exercise - Select a TypeScript editor

You can write TypeScript code in any text editor or IDE of your choice.

In this exercise, you'll learn about your text-editor options and then set up Visual Studio Code so you can complete the remaining exercises in this module.

## The TypeScript Playground
Earlier, you wrote some simple TypeScript code in the Playground. The Playground is a place where you can write, share, and learn TypeScript. You can use it to:

Learn TypeScript in a place where nothing can break.
Experiment with TypeScript syntax and share the URLs with others.
Experiment with the various compiler features of TypeScript.
In this course, you'll occasionally visit the Playground to try out new TypeScript concepts.

### Integrated development environments
For more full-featured TypeScript editing and tools, you'll find many integrated development environments (IDEs) that support TypeScript or have plug-ins or tooling packages that are developed to support it. In this module, we use Visual Studio Code, but you're free to use whatever editor you prefer.

### Install Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is a free, lightweight source code editor that runs on your desktop on the macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js, and it has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and runtimes.

To install Visual Studio Code:

Go to the Visual Studio Code download page, and select the download option for your operating system.

If you need additional setup guidance, visit the installation page for your operating system:

Linux
macOS
Windows
Now that you have a code editor, you're ready to install TypeScript.
