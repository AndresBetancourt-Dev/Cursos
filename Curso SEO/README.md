Animations
To ensure you get the most value from this course, I invested heavily and hired a professional video animator!

We sat down together and came up with the engaging animation visuals which you're about to see in the next few sections of the course.

These animations will help enhance your learning experience and make it easier to understand exactly how specific elements of SEO work.

SEO can indeed be complex, but I'm here to make it easy :)

Enjoy

Keyword Research -> Content Generation -> Onpage SEO -> Offpage SEO -> Measure Progress

Word of warning
This section explains the fundamentals of SEO.

If you already have SEO experience and understand the basics then you may want to skip this section and move straight onto Section 4 which is "Keyword research".

However, the choice is completely yours.

If you are completely new to SEO then I highly recommend you do not skip any sections and follow the course from start to finish.


Enjoy :)
