Section 3: What Is SEO And Why Is It Important:



What is SEO? SEO stands for search engine optimization and is the practice of increasing the quality and quantity of traffic to your website through organic search engine results. Organic traffic is any traffic that you do not pay for. So here's an example from Google. As you can see, I went over to Google and I typed in a yoga mat and from that keyword I get multiple listings on the page. The first type of listing I get is what we call the Google shopping ads, which is this big section up here. You can tell it's an ad as it says sponsored in the top right-hand corner. Below that, we have another ad as it says right there, and then below that, we had the organic listings. So when you optimize a website correctly for SEO, you're going to appear in their organic section.
