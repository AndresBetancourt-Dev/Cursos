Negative SEO is effectively the opposite of positive SEO. Instead of attempting to approve a site's search ranking, the aim of negative SEO is to demote a competing site, or even in some cases, have it completely removed from the search results. There's tons of different negative SEO techniques people use, such as sending thousands of spam links, sending fake link removal requests, fake reviews, and so on, and so on.
