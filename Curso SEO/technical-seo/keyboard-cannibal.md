What Is REALLY Classified As Keyword Cannibalization?
I've received a lot of questions from students asking:

Which of the below would you classify as Keyword cannibalism:

"Two URLs ranking on google search for the same keyword and their SERP is consistent"

OR

"Two URLs completing on google search for the same keyword and they keep bouncing from page one to two, Google is confused which one should rank"



It's a great question so I wanted to update the course to include a new lecture to clarify my view on this:

If you have 2 pages on the first page of Google at the same time, then I would not classify this as a problem.

Taking up two spots in the first page is a bonus as you get more digital real estate.

It's only a problem if 2 pages are competing for a spot on the first page, which is when you'll see the fluctuations happen.

To your success
