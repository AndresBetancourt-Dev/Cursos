Howdy SEO Fans,

I wanted to update the course and include another lecture to highlight that Semrush does also have a FREE version which you can use from the get go, or after you use the free 14 day trial provided in the above lecture.

The free version has some limitations as you would expect e.g you can only carry out 10 searches per day, however, if you are just starting out with SEO and want to get your feet wet then this free version should be more than sufficient :)

I'm committed to highlighting as many free tools and options students can use to minimize the barrier to entry with SEO.

To your success

As promised, I will always update this course to ensure it contains the best information!

Well, a new keyword research tool has come out so its only right I update the course to let you know about it :)

The tool is called  "Keyword Surfer" and its a Google chrome extension.

The great thing about Keyword Surfer is that it provides you with exact monthly search volumes! (See below)


Notes
A couple of things to note, as its a free tool, there are a few limitations such as:

- It does not allow you to see what keywords a site ranks for, it just provides you with search volume data
- Its a dedicated keyword research tool, meaning it has no function to check out what backlinks a website has.

Although its still a great alternative and option you can use when starting out!

Here's a link to the extension: Keyword Surfer
