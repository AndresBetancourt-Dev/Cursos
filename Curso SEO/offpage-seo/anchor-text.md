What is anchor text?

Anchor text refers to the clickable words

used to link one webpage to another.

The color of the text is usually blue,

as it's an actual hyperlink.

So why is anchor text important?

SEO best practices dictate that anchor text

should be relevant to the page you're linking to,

rather than generic.

Google can actually read this anchor text

and they take it into consideration when ranking a website.

For example, if you link to a website

with the anchor text blue hat,

then Google is going to assume that page you're linking to

has some relation to blue hats.

As you can imagine, there are different types

of anchor texts you can use when linking to a webpage.
