Hey everyone,

In the past few lectures, we looked at how to add heading tags on WordPress websites.

However, if you do not own a WordPress website/ any website that isn't built on a CMS then you may not see a drop-down menu where you can select a heading e.g an H1 tag.

To add these tags to your page, you need to manually insert the HTML tag for each header for example:

H1 = <h1> Insert your heading text </h1>

H2 = <h2> Insert your heading text </h2>

H3 = <h3> Insert your heading text </h3>

etc etc

I hope that helps
