# Internal Links

An internally is simply a link from one of your pages

that links to another one of your pages.

The link has to be from one page to another,

which are both on your website, hence the name internal.

Internal links are great for increasing the relevancy of a page.

And relevancy is a massive,

massive on-page SEO ranking factor.


As essentially, to rank high on Google for a keyword,

we need to convince Google that our page is relevant

to what that person typed in.

So, if you have a page on your website

that is about yoga mats, for example,

then you need to convince Google

that your page is indeed about yoga mats.

If you do this correctly,

then you're much more likely to rank for that keyword.

Here's a visual representation

showing you exactly how internal links work.

So, as you can see from my lovely diagram that I made,

we have two pages on a website.
