# Routing

Watches the url, renders different content
Change what's on the screen based on the url

React Router it's a great package but it's extra code that you have to write

In NextJS you define pages and routes with files and folders instead of code

Less code, less work, highly understandable.

Features : Dynamic Routes, Dynamic Parameters
