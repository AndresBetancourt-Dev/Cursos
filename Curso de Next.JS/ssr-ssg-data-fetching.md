# Data Fetching

Fetching data is not as good as in next js because
React by default returns an empty dom

Fetch data after something was loaded
Server-side and Client-side

## How nextjs prepares the dom
### Pre-rendering
/some-route

#### NextJs
Request - Return a pre-rendered page Good for SEO
Hydrate with react code once loaded

#### React (standard)
Request Empty html file

Two ways to pre-rendering
Static Site Generation
Pre-generated in advance during build time

Server-side Rendering
Pages aren't created just in time
