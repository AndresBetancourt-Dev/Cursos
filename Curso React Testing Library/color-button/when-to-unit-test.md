# When to unit test
when functions are really simple it's better that they are covered by functional tests

For more complicated functions, unit tests help with:
    - Covering all possible edge cases.
    - Determining whtat caused the functional tests to fail

Issue with functional tests:
    - High-Level makes them resistant to refactors
    - High-Level makes them difficult to diagnose
