# Test Driven Development

Write tests before writing code
- then write code according to "spec" set by tests
Red green testing
    - Tests fail before code is written


### Steps
- Write shell function
- Write tests
- Tests fail
- Write code
- Tests pass

## Why TDD
- Makes a huge difference in how it feels to write tests
- Part of the coding process, not a chore to do at the end
- More efficient
- Re-run tests for free after changes
