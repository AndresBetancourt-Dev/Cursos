# TDD vs BDD

## BDD 
- Quick detour for BDD: Behavior-Driven Development
- Testing library encourages testing behavior over implementation
- So should'nt we be calling this BDD instead of TDD?
    - actually, no.
BDD is very explicitly defined
    - involves collaboration between lots of roles
    - developers, QA, Bussiness partners, etc
    - defines process for different groups to interact
    - In this course, only developers, so TDD
