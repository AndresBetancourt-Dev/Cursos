# Functional Testing

Different mindset from unit testing

## Unit tests
💬 Isolated mock dependencies, test internals
👍🏼 Very easy to pinpoint failures
❌ Further from how users interact with software
❌ More likely to break with refactoring

## Functional tests
💬 Include all relevant units, test behaviour
👍🏼 Close how users interact with software
👍🏼 Robusts tests
❌ More difficult ot debug failling tests
