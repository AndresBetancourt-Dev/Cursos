# Introduction

We gain knowledge about the behaviour of the physical universe via the scientific method, we gain knowledge about the behaviour of our software via a system of assertion, observation, and experimentatio called "testing".

Unit testing is a technique using which individual modules or functionalities are tested by the developers to determine the functional correctness of a standalone module.

Unit tests are typically automated tests written and run by a software developers to ensure that a section of an application (known as the "unit") meets its design and behaves as intended.

## Unit test philosophies

Much like we gain knowledge about the behaviour of the physical universe via the scientific method, we gain knowledge about the behavior of our software via a system of assertion, observation, and experimentation called "testing". and including unit tests in our system provides the ensurity of behavior of the application

Advantages

- Code quality
- Find bugs early
- Facilitates changes and simplifies integration
- Provides documentation
- Debugging Process
- Reduce costs
- Unit tests as KPI (Performance indicator)

`A performance indicator or key performance indicator is a type of performance measurement. KPIs evaluate the success of an organization or of a particular activity in which it engages. `
