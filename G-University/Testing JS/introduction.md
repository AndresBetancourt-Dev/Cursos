Introduction

we gain knowledge about the behaviour of the physical universe via the scientific method, we gain knowledge about the behaviour of our software via a system of assertion, observation, and experimentatio called "testing".

Advantages
- Code quality 
- Find bugs early
- Facilitates changes and simplifies integration
- Provides documentation
- Debugging Process
- Reduce costs
